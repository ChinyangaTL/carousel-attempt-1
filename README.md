## Overview

### The challenge
Attempt to clone Mobirise's PROMO template carousel, using Kevin Powell's carousel tutorial to implement. COMPLELTION PENDING

Link to complete template

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

WORK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE (I'm tired as it is from the day before me and I need to push something)

- Find a way to only display current slide as overflow: hidden; isn't working.
- Not do anything when trying to scroll past the first or last element.
- Eventually have it be automatic - research still needed.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's JS Carousel Video](https://youtu.be/gBzsE0oieio) - This helped me to at least get a rudimentary understanding of how the carousel works. I got the basic skeleton of what I needed. Another rewatch and or studying other resources is needed so I can find an independant way of deploying into my own projects.  n. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
